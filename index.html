				This site is my portfolio site, which includes some of my past architectural designs, as well as some photography. Architecture projects include: A fashion hub design after a redefinition of fashion. A renovation of a collective house in an urban village full of history and stories. A translation and reinterpretation of Fujian Tulou, a kind of traditional Chinese building, to modern architecture. A design of a cat home from a non-anthropocentric perspective. A restoration and redesign proposal for a brownfield in Trenton and a vaporwave-styled rendering of a bagel. The photographic works are mainly some shots during travel and daily life.

		</h1>
		<p class="mainp">
			I am an architect and a designer, engaging in a design-related field. I used to design more architecture works, from large projects such as museum design to small projects such as house and kindergarten design. In addition to traditional architecture design, I am currently studying computational design. I enjoy travel, manga, photography and reading, and I believe that architects have a responsibility to change the society. Through design I hope to express our social structure, human relationships, and to promote social changes.
